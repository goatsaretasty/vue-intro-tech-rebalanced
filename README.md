## Walkthrough

1. `main.js` is where you import your libraries and modular functions nand instantiate your `Vue` instance.
2. `App.vue` is a Single File Component (SFC) that wraps the entire project. It's your application's root component.

## Concepts
* Declarative rendering data using interpolation (these are the curly braces)
* Reactivity - when our data changes, Vue will update all the places where we are using it!
* Modularity - build reusable components
